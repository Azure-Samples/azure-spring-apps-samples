## Overview

Azure Spring Cloud is a PaaS to help you easily run and operate Spring Cloud based microservices on Azure. The goal of Azure Spring Cloud is to let you focus on your code and let us take care of the operation work. Rich features are provided and some of the highlighted ones are:
- Managed native Spring Cloud Service Registry
- Managed native Spring Cloud Config Server
- Managed native Spring Cloud Distributed Tracing with Azure AppInsights
- Built-in metrics aggregration and monitoring
- Built-in logs aggregation and search
- Zero code change is required to run your Spring Boot apps in Azure Spring Cloud

You can find more details about Azure Spring Cloud in the [official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/spring-cloud/).

> NOTE:
